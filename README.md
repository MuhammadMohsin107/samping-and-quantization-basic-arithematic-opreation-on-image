Sampling

Sampling changes spatial resolution by reducing or increasing the number of pixels.
Downsampling removes details; upsampling enlarges the image but adds blur.

🎚️ Quantization

Quantization changes gray-level resolution by reducing the number of intensity levels (e.g., from 256 → 16).
It makes the image look posterized or blocky.

🔢 Arithmetic Operations

These operations perform pixel-wise mathematical transformations that help in:

Image blending

Brightness/contrast adjustment

Image differencing
